# Introduction
Fox Box Insurance is a Discord bot focused on server backups, channel exports, and data security.
With FBI, you can easily safeguard your server's content and ensure your community stays protected.

## Our Mission
Our mission is to better protect Discord communities by providing robust backup and export tools.
We believe that server data is valuable and should be easily recoverable in case of accidents or malicious actions.
By offering reliable backup solutions, we aim to give server admins peace of mind and help them maintain a safe environment for their members.

## Pledge of Transparency
We are committed to being open and transparent about how the bot works, what data it accesses, and how that data is used.
We will never sell or share your data with third parties. Furthermore, all code is open source and available for review on [GitHub](https://github.com/FoxBox-Insurance/FoxBoxInsurance).
The community will always come first in our decision-making process and we welcome any feedback and contributions from users.

## Hosting
A quick foreword; You are not expected to host FBI yourself due to many complexities.
If you wish to set up and host your own instance, you are free to do so, but please be aware that you are responsible for the security and maintenance of your instance.
We recommend using our official bot instance by inviting it to your server [here](https://notfbi.dev/invite).

We are not responsible for any data loss or security breaches that may occur on self-hosted instances!
