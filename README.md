This website is built using [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/), a modern static website generator. Huge thanks to the team! <3

## Setup

Install dependencies using npm or yarn. This only needs to be done once.
```bash
npm i
```

This command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window.
Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.
```bash
npm run start
```

This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be served using any static contents hosting service.
```bash
npm run build
```

And after building you can serve the website publicly. Please note the target port in `package.json` and change it as you need.
```bash
npm run serve
```
