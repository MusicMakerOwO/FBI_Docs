Fox Box Insurance (FBI) is a collection of tools and services built to make Discord safer, more transparent, and secure. Instead of focusing on traditional moderation commands, FBI prioritizes data ownership, full transparency, and user empowerment. FBI is forever built for you - the user - and you control everything about the bot.

## Why FBI?
Discord bots usually revolve around commands like `ban`, `kick`, and `warn`. All of these bots focus on *preventing* chaos but never really prepare for it. FBI is built to do the opposite - recover after chaos and put power back into your hands where it belongs. Full server backups, channel exports, and way more coming *very* soon. FBI is built primarily for admins and developers who want deeper insight and tighter control.

## Setup
This website is built using [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/), a modern static website generator. Huge thanks to the team! <3

Install dependencies using npm or yarn. This only needs to be done once.
```bash
npm i
```

This command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window.
Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.
```bash
npm run start
```

This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be served using any static contents hosting service.
```bash
npm run build
```

And after building you can serve the website publicly. Please note the target port in `package.json` and change it as you need.
```bash
npm run serve
```
